    "Given a grid with w as width, h as height. A company wants to develop an office park in the grid where each cell represents a potential building lot. The goal is for the furthest of all lots to be as near as possible to an office building. Given an input n, which is the number of buildings to be placed in the lot, determine the building placement to minimize the distance the most distant empty lot is from the building. Distance is measured in horizontal and vertical directions, i.e. diagonal distance measurement is not considered.\n",
